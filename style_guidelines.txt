Overall look and feel statement:
  The website provides a modern up-and-going vibe with mild focus on an academic feel. This is accomplished with our cool blue colour palette to give a genuine trustable feel while providing a contrast so that viewers are more likely to comfortably see our benefits. We use images that include modern archetecture and urban buildings with touches of greenery to give off an exploration vibe that appeals to both nature enthusiasts and brutalist fans.

Colors:
  For Campus Nav, our choice of colors represent effortlessness, ease and simplicity. The pallete is inspired by calming tones of blue with simple shades of light gray. We have some gold thrown in for our premium pricing. 

  We have decided to use a light theme for the website to emulate the feeling of a traditional hand-drawn map.

Links:
  Our links are identified with a simple underline and a change in cursor upon hover.

Buttons:
    We use simple and clean rectangular buttons with rounded corners because we do not want the website to be overstimulating with over-designed shaders and other obfuscations. 

Accessibility:
  Our images have alternate text and the site is screen reader compatible to make it accessible for people with vision disabilities [*test this!]
